# Crumbls-Cache
Caching for WP via PHPFastCache
Not for production.

Works 100%, just not 100% tested.

Looking for testing areas for all of the possible cache types.  If you have one of these and would like to help, please shoot me an email or fork away.  

Default caching is file.  Options -> Cache.
